# Meduza
Personal Render engine project by Nick Wagter
The purpose of this project is to learn DirectX12 and how to write a Graphics Engine.

# What will it contain
This project is in the early stages of development and does not contain a lot yet,
but what is currently planned is the following :

- Rendering
  - 2D Rendering
    - Textured Quads
    - Sprite Animator
  - 3D Rendering
    - Geometry
      - Cubes
      - Spheres
      - Planes
    - Object Loading
      - Obj
      - glTF
    - Lights
      - Point Lights
      - Directional Lights
    - Skeletal animations

# Graphics APIs :
- OpenGL
- DirectX 12

# Libraries Used :
- ImGui
- Optick
- GLM
- GLAD

# Project description
Meduza will be a static library that will be as user friendly as possible.

The executable will be a seperate project containing examples on how to use the renderer and some tools using ImGui to show what is possible to do with the engine.

The reason for this project is to learn more about graphics programming and provide a useable library for others not interested in graphics programming but in need of an library that can do it for them.

<b> This project is not a game tool like SFML it is just a renderer how you use it is up to you!<b>
